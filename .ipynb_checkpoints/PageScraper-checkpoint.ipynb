      "Upgrading low temperature waste water streams of separation processes with compression resorption heat pumps.\n",
      "Goal\n",
      "The goal of the COMPRESORP project is to upgrade low temperature waste streams from the process industry (e.g. cooling water from cooling towers) into valuable utility streams making use of compression-resorption heat pumps which operate in the wet regime.\n",
      "Incentive\n",
      "Thermal energy (heat) represents a large part of the global energy usage and about 43% of this energy is used for industrial applications. Ultimately, 20-50% of the energy used is lost via waste heat contained in hot exhaust gases and liquid streams. Nevertheless the share of waste heat recovery (upgraded energy) within the total energy used is still negligible.\n",
      "Compression Resorption heat Pumps (CRHP) can be used to upgrade waste water streams to streams which are applicable for heating and cooling purposes. In this way the rest heat available inthese streams can be re-used in the separation processes. Waste water streams with temperatures in the range 35 to 60°C can be partly cooled down to 5°C and partly heated up to temperatures above the 110°C. These product flows with higher exergy can be used in separation processes which need cooling / heating respectively. Limiting for the commercial introduction of these cycles in practice is the unavailability of compressors which can operate under the operating conditions required by these cycles.\n",
      "Objective\n",
      "The focus of this project is on the development of a compressor suitable for the operating conditions of compression resorption cycle and its integration in the cycle.\n",
      "Simplified P&ID of the experimental set-up\n",
      "Twin screw compressor\n",
      "A compressor prototype suitable for the operating conditions of compression-resorption heat pump cycles for heat recovery will be designed and experimentally tested.\n",
      "Results\n",

      "R-ACES is an international project promoted by 8 partners, from 6 European countries. Each country, has a vision to support high-potential industry parks and clusters to become fully fledged ecoregions. R-ACES means a step-change in the contribution of European industry to the climate targets of the EU. The goal is to reduce emissions at the ecoregions by at least 10%.\n",
      "After all, the industry sector represents 25% of all energy demand – and 50% of the total cooling and heating demand on the continent. Yet, only 16% comes from renewables. Concluding, that by focusing on collective measures and clustering, we can drastically increase the efficiency of industry.\n",
      "Our vision\n",
      "Therefore, the vision of R-ACES is to support high-potential industrial parks and clusters to become ecoregions. There, we aim to achieve CO2 emissions reduction of at least 10%. For example by exchanging surplus energy and making extensive use of renewables. Finally, we can bring everything together with so-called smart energy management systems.\n",

To realize this goal four parties will work together; BioMCN as the end-user, HeatMatrix as the technology supplier, Stork as the EPC contractor and the ISPT as a networking agent for sustainable process innovation.\n",
      "About the Project\n",
      "BioMCN in Delfzijl is a methanol producer who uses natural gas as feedstock. They also produce waste gas that has a temperature of about 300 degrees Celsius. BioMCN is looking for technical and financially feasible methods to extract energy from these waste gasses and put them to good use.\n",
      "Conventional heat-return-systems cannot function in the temperature-range of 150-50 degrees. This is why HeatMatrix is working on a so-called ‘Polymer Heat Exchanger’. HeatMatrix is a Shell Spin-out company. The material (plastic) and the design have been specially designed for the lower ranges. In the past few years different test-setups have been built on different scales (5 KW and 500KW) with the support of the ministry of economic affairs. The process Industry however is looking for setups that are 10 times bigger than the ones that were tested (5MW). And as long as this technique hasn’t been proven to work on this large scale further commercialisation is difficult.\n",
      "The project will be a demonstration project and it will include a knowledge dissemination program. Stork will be in charge of the engineering, preparation and implementation of the required adjustments of the methanol-factory.\n",
      "Engineering will be start up in November 2017 and equipment purchasing process will start up in 2018. When the technology is operational the results will be monitored. The setup will be available as showcase and demo-setup. ISPT will provide the knowledge distribution for this project.\n",

      "UH-30-02\n",
      "Status\n",
      "Ongoing\n",
      "Start date\n",
      "January 1, 2019\n",
      "The FLEXSTEAM project aims to improve the way we can store and re-use  thermal energy by using so called ‘Phase Changing Materials’ (PCMs).\n",
      "To achieve a fully circular economy we will have to be able to close our material but also our energy loops. Re-using, storing and upgrading energy is an essential part of creating a sustainable system. In the industry a large part of the energy usage comes in the form of heat.\n",
      "Heat buffering is very important for the integration of heat pumps in existing industrial processes. By focusing on the efficiency of processes as well as replacing fossil resources with renewable ones we will be able to greatly reduce the industrial sectors’ dependence on fossil energy.\n",
      "About the FLEXSTEAM project\n",
      "A challenge lies in the storage of energy when the availability of sustainable resources to run for example the heat-pumps varies. Storing energy is in fact one of the biggest challenges we face in the energy transition because of the varying availability of renewable resources. Electrical storage is very expensive whereas thermal storage can be achieved relatively cheap by using so called ‘Phase Changing Materials’ or PCM’s. Often a composition of salts or organic materials, PCM’s change from solid to liquid and in the process store latent heat. This way they can store a lot of heat in a small amount of volume.\n",
      "Steam storing\n",
      "The technology developed will be used for the recovery and re-use of industrial leftover (waste) heat, directly as well as indirectly through the use of heat pumps. Apart from that it will also be able to increase the implementation rates of sustainable heat sources like geothermal and solar energy to generate process heat. Both can be used more effectively and efficiently if a thermal energy storage solution is present.\n",
      "The FLEXSTEAM project is a joint exercise by TNO (project coordinator), ISPT, Royal Cosun, DOW, TataSteel B.V, Blue Terra and Bronswerk.\n",
      "Progress and Results\n",
      "Applications for thermal storage are identified within the processes at TataSteel and at DOW. At TataSteel the thermal storage is to be integrated in a waste heat recovery application, to generate steam. The storage system creates additional energy and cost savings by covering the mismatch between waste heat supply and steam demand. A dynamic simulation of the thermal storage system was done to calculate these annual savings, and will be used as a tool for further optimizing the sizing of the storage system. \n",
      "At DOW the thermal storage is to be connected with the on-site CHP system, to enhance the flexible operation. The technical requirements for this thermal storage system are beyond the current possibilities of the PCM concept due to the higher temperature needed in this application. The study is focused on the general techno-economic feasibility of the thermal storage, when facilitating the flex-CHP operation in the 2030 energy system, with fluctuating prices for electricity and increased CO2 taxes.\n",
      "The technical development in the project, addresses the characterization and selection of a suitable PCM, optimizing the thermal conductivity of the PCM, and the development of a modular solution for PCM elements that allow industrialized production on a larger scale. Adipic acid is selected as low cost thermal storage material. It shows a very stable performance during 98 cycles of repeated melting and solidification (Figure 1).\n",
      "With its melting temperature of 150°C it can be used to store and generate steam at 3 bar. The thermal conductivity of adipic acid is enhanced by adding graphite to it. This allows to reach charging and discharging times in the range of one hour. The composite PCM is contained in sealed tubular elements. The thermal performance in terms of charge and discharge times of these elements is characterized in laboratory tests and can be adapted to the application requirements by selecting the diameter of the tubes.\n",
      "The design of the laboratory prototype system is based on a conventional shell & tube concept, where the tubes consist of the PCM filled  elements, closely stacked together. The PCM thermal system will be thermally charged by applying steam to the outside of the tubes, heating them above the melting temperature. In discharge mode hot water is circulated along the tubes, which will transfer their heat to generate steam again.  The prototype design is finished and construction has started.\n",
      "Outlook\n",
      "The first tests of the system will start in Q1-2021. Initial tests will be used to characterize the thermal performance in terms of storage capacity and heat transfer rates. Various operating conditions will be applied and results will be used to validate the thermal system model of the prototype system.\n",
      "The test results and performance chart will also be used as input for calculating the techno-economic feasibility in the considered applications at Tatasteel and DOW. When successful results are obtained the next step is to develop a pilot project for on-site testing.\n",

      "Incentive\n",
      "High temperature industrial heat pumps are an emerging technology that play a decisive role in providing a sustainable solution for industrial heat demand up to 200°C. Previous ISPT and TKI E&I projects (CATCH-IT, STEPS) have demonstrated the operation of pilot scale compression heat pumps for industrial applications, however CAPEX costs in the order of 500 €/kWth proved to be prohibitive for market introduction.\n",
      "Market and cost reduction studies in the CRUISE project (ongoing) revealed that typical industrial capacities are 1-10 MWth and a lack of standardization for these units and the use of a flammable refrigerant were the most important cost determining factors. However, use of a non-flammable synthetic working medium (HFOs) still poses concerns about not being a long term sustainable solution.\n",
      "The development and success of an industrial heat pump market is indeed dependent on the ability to produce a standardized, modular, flexible compression heat pump technology on a scale level of 1-10 MWth that uses a natural refrigerant and has low CAPEX.\n",
      "Objectives\n",
      "The specific goals to be achieved within the duration of the FUSE project are defined as follows:\n",
      "Develop a full-scale (1-2 MW), steam producing, industrial heat pump using natural working media that uses waste heat sources in the range of 60°C-90°C and produces medium pressure steam (range of 2-5 bar) with a specific investment cost of < 200 €/kWth (excluding integration).\n",
      "Develop a modular compression heat pump design utilizing a limited number of standardized components that can be configured in numerous ways to cover > 70% of the industrial heat pump market. This enables series production and therewith low costs (< 200 €/kWth) and offers still flexibility with respect to operating conditions (power, temperature).\n",
      "Establish a Dutch manufacturer (Heinen & Hopman) for the standardized, modular, flexible compression heat pump.\n",
      "Establish heat pump performance under a variety of simulated (industrial process data) static and dynamical conditions at ECN part of TNO, and under field test conditions at the DOW Terneuzen site.\n",
      "Activities\n",
      "Within this project, a consortium of Dutch partners will cooperate to accelerate the uptake of industrial heat pumps using natural working media. A full scale (1-2 MWth) compression heat pump is designed, constructed and tested. Its performance will be characterized through testing on a specifically created industrial heat pump test infrastructure at ECN part of TNO that is able to simulate a variety of process conditions.\n",
      "In addition, the unit will be field tested at DOW Terneuzen. The heat pump is designed using a modular approach utilizing a limited number of standardized components that can be configured in numerous ways to cover a large share of the industrial heat pump market. Partner Heinen & Hopman will implement the necessary measures for establishing a Dutch manufacturer for industrial, steam producing heat pumps.\n",
      "Results\n",
      "Successful completion of this project results in an industrial compression heat pump product for a Dutch manufacturer at scale levels of 1-10 MW that can be produced in a standardized, modular, flexible, and cost effective way and uses a natural refrigerant. This product is able to serve a large share of the industrial heat pump market. As such, this project contributes to economic growth, such as the creation of new jobs in the heat pump sector and increasing the competitiveness of Dutch industry. Finally, the uptake of industrial heat pumps contributes to the sustainability of Dutch industry through large reductions in both CO2 emissions and primary energy consumption.\n",

      "This project creates greenfield conceptual design packages for contact and convective drying of a full scale. In addition, it focuses on establishing a fully heat pump integrated drying process, including a selection of main components, process flow diagram, control philosophy, and draft lay out drawings.\n",
      "Drying processes account for 15% of industrial energy consumption. In some processes, e.g. paper production, up to 70% of the energy is used for drying. Improving of the energy efficiency of drying processes will therefore contribute significantly to energy saving targets and to the reduction of the CO2 emissions. All bulk drying processes are either convective or contact drying. Both contact drying and convective drying are suitable for heat pump application. The installed process equipment in brown field situations is not designed to be suitable for heat pump applications both in the systems which supply process heat as well as in the heat recovery systems. Connecting a heat pump straight onto existing installations will therefore give rise to even more inefficiencies. The next step in heat pump development concentrates on heat pump process integration: drying functionality is designed including the heat pump functionality. \n",
      "For an optimal design both technical and economic factors for the integral heat pump driven drying systems will be modelled and calculated looking to find the optimal balance between standardization and customization. Cost calculations for the different systems will be made to enable the establishment of economic feasibility and comparison of the different designs.

      "Wet compression allows for close to isothermal conditions during compression resulting in higher compression isentropic efficiencies. It further prevents operation in the superheating zone of the working fluids of heat pumps which are associated with large energy losses and the related unacceptably high discharge temperatures which cause problems in the compressors of high temperature heat pumps.\n",
      "The project\n",
      "In the frame of Upgrading Low Temperature Waste Water Streams of Separation Processes with Compression (UH-20-10) project, currently under progress at TU Delft, AtlasCopco has created a prototype oil free wet compressor. At the end of this project experiments to determine its performance under high temperature heat pump conditions will be available showing its potential.\n",
      "The data collected and reported in UH-20-10 concerns only the conditions at the inlet and outlet nozzles of the compressor. These data allow for validation of the global performance of the model which has been developed but is does not allow for identification of the sources of losses.\n",
      "Oil free compressor for ammonia based high temperature heat pumps\n",
      "This proposal aims to modify the prototype so that the variation of the internal pressure with the cavity volume can be experimentally determined. These data will allow for a detailed identification of the sources of losses during the compression process. In this way the model developed in project UH-20-10 can be validated in more detail and where needed adjusted to represent the different sources of losses more accurately. The, in this way improved, compressor model will then be integrated in the complete compression resorption heat pump model to predict the heat pump performance in high temperature applications.\n",
      "In parallel a compression resorption heat pump will be designed on paper which integrates the lessons learned from the compressor prototype and modeling into a next generation commercial compressor adapted for this purpose and which also integrates the other components of the heat pump. The designed heat pump capacity will be sized similar to the present compressor prototype to about 250 kW heating power.\n",
      "Results\n",
      "The system has been operated with an ammonia concentration of 30% in an ammonia water solution. Compressor inlet conditions around 60 °C (this corresponds to a heat source of about 65 °C) and vapour inlet qualities in the range 50 to 90 %.\n",
      "The experimental data show clearly that larger amounts of liquid at the suction port (lower vapour quality) guarantees the sealing of the leakage paths and allow for higher pressure ratios.\n",
      "Left: Pressure ratio as function of compressor inlet quality; Right: temperature lift across the compressor. In both figures the rotational speed has been varied.\n",
      "The figure on the right hand side shows how the vapour inlet quality affects the temperature rise as the working fluid passes the compressor. Discharge temperatures are up to 125 °C so that heat could be delivered to an application at 120 °C.\n",

Moreover, companies struggle with the high variability and price of electricity.  \n",

For this reason, the Flexible Efficient Electrification of Industrial Heat Cases project develops two different simulations that will allow companies to share their insights into the specific challenges of industrial heat driven processes, without having to share company specific confidential information. This open innovation concept also allows technology suppliers to cooperate and communicate about concrete solutions for realistic and recognizable industrial processes.

      "To further develop the compact electrically driven thermoacoustic heat (TA) pump technology and to prepare for technical demonstration on full scale.\n",
      "The industry is a large consumer of energy and about two-thirds of the industry’s energy use is represented by heat. Often high-temperature heat is required, this heat is currently provided by burning natural gas. In order for the industry to meet the climate goals we will need to move to low carbon heating systems. One way to achieve this is by implementing high temperature heat pumps. These heat pumps, however, are not yet commercially available. The COMTA project proposes to start using the electrically driven thermoacoustic heat pump for industrial purposes. It can deliver heat of up to 200°C and it can cover a very wide range of temperatures with a fixed standardized design. Because this heat pump is electrically driven, it will become completely carbon free once fully renewable electricity supplies have become a reality in the future.\n",
      "About the COMTA project\n",
      "The overall project objective is to further develop the compact electrically driven thermoacoustic heat (TA) pump technology and to prepare for technical demonstration on full scale. This is achieved by experimental demonstration of a high COP1 over a very wide temperature interval from 100 to over 200°C using waste heat between 50-150°C under simulated and onsite test conditions (at DOW Terneuzen utility). A single full scale modular design will be realized that can serve a wide market including (petro)chemical industry, refining, paper & food industry. By its modular design steam production can be matched to the process in the range of 1 to 10 MW by installing one up to 8 units on the piston compressor. Energy is saved and a carbon free heat supply can be realized utilizing renewable electricity.\n",
      "The project is coordinated by ECN.TNO. Other partners are ISPT, DOW, Bronswerk Heat Transfer and Howden Compressors B.V.\n",
      "Aimed Results\n",
      "The COMTA proposal serves as a last stop before full scale demonstration projects are initiated. The remaining R&D work serves to improve efficiency concerns optimizing membrane and heat exchangers. This is addressed by means of experimental component testing within the existing COMTA test set-up. Integration at the DOW steam utility and the onsite testing will verify the technical feasibility under operational conditions. Realization of the full scale design will be used for the verification of the techno-economic feasibility and to prepare for the full scale testing in demo projects.\n",
      "This development results in net primary energy saving potential of 97 PJ per year and a CO2 emission reduction of 4.5 million tons/year within the sectors food, paper & board bulk chemical and refineries in the Netherlands. Major fuel cost savings for Dutch industry amounting to 4.8 billion Euro can be realized. In the future renewable electricity system carbon free electricity would result in even higher CO2 emission of 9.4 million tons/year. The worldwide market value for high temperature (steam) TA heat pump equipment and installation is estimated at 227 million euro per year during 20 years.\n",
      "Status November 2020\n",
      "Major developments in COMTA are the utilisation of an industrial piston compressor as driver and the strongly reduced dimensions of the pressure vessel (no resonator has been applied). Both developments will reduce future investment costs of the heat pump.\n",
      "The COMTA heat pump set-up is commissioned in March 2020 and first successful tests series have been executed including recent tests with saturated steam delivery at 168 °C.\n",
      "The saturated steam is pumped from source heat delivered by an oil circuit at 94 °C. The compressor ran at 1055 rpm and a dynamic pressure amplitude of almost 2.9 bars is obtained with a static pressure of 29 bars.\n",
      "The internal COP in the thermoacoustic core amounts to 41% of the Carnot efficiency. This number however excludes a high temperature loss in the heat exchangers and mechanical losses in the compressor.\n",
      "Outlook\n",
      "The thermoacoustic heat pump part originates from a previous test setup (TASTE) and this part will be optimised for the COMTA conditions (lower drive frequency). A large increase of thermal output is expected by an increase of the working pressure, optimised heat exchangers and a new regenerator suitable for the lower frequency. In this case even higher steam delivery temperatures up to 200 °C will become feasible. Measurement of the mechanical power delivery by the piston will give insight in system losses and guidance for further improvements.\n",

      "A large part of powdered formulations within the food industry is produced by spray drying. The powder properties, such as its bulk density, flowability and reconstitution behaviour, are influenced by the level of agglomeration occurring during the spray drying process. In the project StAgglop we aim to improve agglomeration control in industrial spray dryers, which can reduce energy use and off-spec powder production in the powder production chain.\n",
      "In short:\n",
      "During large scale production, lack of control of agglomeration negatively impacts operation efficiency of spray dryers and leads to significant material losses\n",
      "Improved agglomeration control will contribute to the reduction of emissions and to meet increasing strict fine dust emission regulations for industrial drying systems\n",
      "StAgglop therefore aims at developing scaling-relations to steer sticky behavior and agglomeration in spray drying processes\n",
      "Reducing emissions by improving agglomeration control\n",
      "Agglomeration during spray drying occurs when a partially-dried droplet collides with another partially-dried droplet or with a fully-dried (agglomerate) particle. There is a complex relationship between drying of droplets and agglomeration dynamics. The period, which starts with generation and exposure of a droplet to high inlet air temperature (resulting in extreme drying rates) and ends with collision with another partially-dried droplet or fully dried (agglomerate) particle is crucial for steering the agglomeration process.\n",
      "In industrial practice, agglomeration is optimised by adapting the position and/or angle of (usually) high pressure nozzles, air flow pattern and presence of fines return to obtain agglomerated powder of desired quality. This approach is trial-and-error based and needs to be continuously repeated for different spray drying systems and products.\n",
      "Lack of control of agglomeration negatively impacts operation efficiency of spray dryers (e.g. due to fouling and lower production capacities) and leads to significant material losses (in the form of off-spec product) during large scale production. It is estimated that for the Netherlands, annually 0.9-1.5 PJ energy or 200-300 kton CO2 eq emission may be reduced by improving agglomeration control in spray dryers. Moreover, improved agglomeration control will contribute to the reduction of fine dust emission from dryers, for which increasingly strict regulations are reinforced by the government.\n",

      "The objective of this project is to develop 50% less expensive heat pump technology that generates heat in an economically feasible way for industrial applications, using waste heat and (renewable) electricity. This technology can be applied cross sectoral and offers large energy savings. The cost target range is between 150-200 €/kWth.\n",
      "In short:\n",
      "Developing a 50% less expensive heat pump technology\n",
      "For industrial application\n",
      "A final report on the cost reduction, new compression heatpump and a market analysis\n",
      "About the CRUISE project\n",
      "The project starts with identifying the specific needs of the industrial end-users and the specific requirements of heat pump integration, by close cooperation between industrial end-users and technology providers. Options for cost reduction are identified by the technology providers and ECN and assessed in a separate work package. Two heat pump concepts (compression & thermoacoustic) will be manufactured and tested that meet the cost objective of this project. Testing of both concepts will be carried out by ECN. A separate work package is devoted to defining the market potential, including dissemination, carried out by ISPT and FME.\n",
      "The achieved results\n",
      "The project results are split up into four sections: cost reductions, compression heat pump, thermo-acoustic heat pump and market analysis. The summary of the results is available below, please check also the CRUISE Public Report (in Dutch) for more details, the report can be downloaded under all project publications.\n",
      "1. Cost reductions\n",
      "The cost reduction study for compression heat pumps shows that serial construction and application of other types of compressors can reduce the investment costs at least in half from the current 500 € / kWth to 250 € / kWth for a system on a 2 MW scale. Based on these principles, a conceptual design with use of non-flammable working medium has been made for a 2 MW heat pump.\n",
      "2. Compression heat pump\n",
      "Results indicate that it is also possible to generate high-temperature heat in the form of steam with a synthetic working medium. It is expected that with the tested working medium in combination with a suitable oil comparable performance, both in terms of delivery temperature and efficiency, can be achieved as Pentane.\n",
      "3. Thermo-acoustic heat pump\n",
      "Within this project it was decided to connect an existing heat pump (TASTE project, TEEI314009) to a new, larger compressor. After design adjustments and starting the compressor, it was found that the intended operating range could not be reached when increasing the speed. The cause of this appears to be a small opening in the (temporary) bypass line. This causes a lot of losses and must be removed. Despite the low pressure amplitude, a clear pumping action was visible. The thermocouples in the system showed a rapid build-up of a temperature gradient across the regenerator, indicating that heat pump operation is taking place.\n",
      "4. Market analyses\n",
      "To determine the market for industrial heat pumps, a bottom-up analysis of applications in the EU-28 has been made. The bottom-up market study shows valuable results regarding the application potential of industrial heat pumps in the EU-28 up to a delivery temperature of 200 ° C. Based on available data, a market potential of 24.6 GW is calculated, which supplies 655 PJ of heat to industrial processes. The study has also increased insight into the desired capacities of an industrial heat pump. The large numbers, and therefore possibilities for series production, are for power sizes <10 MW. The market study can be further improved by better availability of process data.\n",

      "Upgrading low temperature waste water streams of separation processes with compression resorption heat pumps.\n",
      "Goal\n",
      "The goal of the COMPRESORP project is to upgrade low temperature waste streams from the process industry (e.g. cooling water from cooling towers) into valuable utility streams making use of compression-resorption heat pumps which operate in the wet regime.\n",
      "Incentive\n",
      "Thermal energy (heat) represents a large part of the global energy usage and about 43% of this energy is used for industrial applications. Ultimately, 20-50% of the energy used is lost via waste heat contained in hot exhaust gases and liquid streams. Nevertheless the share of waste heat recovery (upgraded energy) within the total energy used is still negligible.\n",
      "Compression Resorption heat Pumps (CRHP) can be used to upgrade waste water streams to streams which are applicable for heating and cooling purposes. In this way the rest heat available inthese streams can be re-used in the separation processes. Waste water streams with temperatures in the range 35 to 60°C can be partly cooled down to 5°C and partly heated up to temperatures above the 110°C. These product flows with higher exergy can be used in separation processes which need cooling / heating respectively. Limiting for the commercial introduction of these cycles in practice is the unavailability of compressors which can operate under the operating conditions required by these cycles.\n",

Each country, has a vision to support high-potential industry parks and clusters to become fully fledged ecoregions. R-ACES means a step-change in the contribution of European industry to the climate targets of the EU. The goal is to reduce emissions at the ecoregions by at least 10%.\n",
      "After all, the industry sector represents 25% of all energy demand – and 50% of the total cooling and heating demand on the continent. Yet, only 16% comes from renewables. Concluding, that by focusing on collective measures and clustering, we can drastically increase the efficiency of industry.\n",
      "Our vision\n",
      "Therefore, the vision of R-ACES is to support high-potential industrial parks and clusters to become ecoregions. There, we aim to achieve CO2 emissions reduction of at least 10%. For example by exchanging surplus energy and making extensive use of renewables. Finally, we can bring everything together with so-called smart energy management systems.\n",
      "Ecoregions\n",
      "An ecoregion is an area where energy, material and information exchanges occur between various companies and actors to reduce waste and energy/ material consumption. Each region is centered on an (eco-)industrial park or (eco-)business park. They are linked to its surroundings by a 4th/5th generation district heating/cooling network. The project condenses the knowledge and experience gathered throughout H2020 into a set of three focused tools embedded in selected support actions.\n",
      "R-ACES Ecoregions\n",
      "R-ACES has set-up 3 pilot cases to test the tools designed by the project in a realistic environment. We have developed these tools for industrial actors and other stakeholders. Currently, the pilots take place in Antwerp, Nyborg and Lombardy.\n",
      "A validation manual will be created for the adoption of additional 7 high-priority regions in Italy, Denmark, Belgium, and the Netherlands. This will add up to 10 ecoregions. We aim to reach another 80 ecoregions through dissemination activities.\n",

      "The goal of this project is to demonstrate the innovative technologies as developed by HeatMatrix in the industrial process in the BioMCN factories.\n",
      "On the one hand this would result in a major energy economization at the BioMCN plants on the other hand it’s meant to create a reference-project for HeatMatrix as a stepping stone to repetition and commercial implementation. To realize this goal four parties will work together; BioMCN as the end-user, HeatMatrix as the technology supplier, Stork as the EPC contractor and the ISPT as a networking agent for sustainable process innovation.\n",
      "About the Project\n",
      "BioMCN in Delfzijl is a methanol producer who uses natural gas as feedstock. They also produce waste gas that has a temperature of about 300 degrees Celsius. BioMCN is looking for technical and financially feasible methods to extract energy from these waste gasses and put them to good use.\n",
      "Conventional heat-return-systems cannot function in the temperature-range of 150-50 degrees. This is why HeatMatrix is working on a so-called ‘Polymer Heat Exchanger’. HeatMatrix is a Shell Spin-out company. The material (plastic) and the design have been specially designed for the lower ranges. In the past few years different test-setups have been built on different scales (5 KW and 500KW) with the support of the ministry of economic affairs. The process Industry however is looking for setups that are 10 times bigger than the ones that were tested (5MW). And as long as this technique hasn’t been proven to work on this large scale further commercialisation is difficult.\n",
      "The project will be a demonstration project and it will include a knowledge dissemination program. Stork will be in charge of the engineering, preparation and implementation of the required adjustments of the methanol-factory.\n",
      "Engineering will be start up in November 2017 and equipment purchasing process will start up in 2018. When the technology is operational the results will be monitored. The setup will be available as showcase and demo-setup. ISPT will provide the knowledge distribution for this project.\n",

      "Results\n",
      "The demonstration project aims to achieve the following results:\n",
      "To realize a significant reduction in energy use at the BioMCN plant.\n",
      "To realize a key reference project for HeatMatrix as a starting point for further commercialization within the process industry.\n",
      "To provide exposure to the Dutch energy intensive industry clusters (Amsterdam, Rotterdam/ Moerdijk, Terneuzen and Geleen). An active replication program under the supervision of the ISPT aiming for 3 repetitions (up to 1.2 PJ).\n",
      "To initiate the exportation of the HeatMatrix technology\n",
      "To create an onset for extra employment opportunities at HeatMatrix and Stork.\n",

    "CodeCP-50-11StatusOngoingStart dateMarch 1, 2023\n",
    "Packaging is crucial to preserve and protect food that we are using daily. To ensure these qualities, PET trays are often used. However, they have been difficult to recycle. CIRCPET aims to make full recycling, transparent and economically competitive trays possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tested and validated fully circular PET tray for (food) packaging\n",
    "New design with improved recyclability, including developing sealing layers\n",
    "Optimal cost-effectiveness in converting post-use trays into homogenous high quality rPET\n",
    "Destined to grow, difficult to recycle\n",
    "The market for PET trays is vast and rapidly growing, making them an essential part of the food supply chain. However, PET trays are currently difficult to recycle due to mixed materials and contamination. As the demand for recycled PET (rPET) in bottles increases, the availability of rPET for trays decreases. This creates an urgent need for the development of a closed-loop system specifically for PET trays.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to address this challenge by creating a fully circular PET tray solution that meets market demands while minimizing environmental impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Achieving circular PET trays\n",
    "The project brings together multiple parties from the PET tray supply chain together with knowledge institutions. Together 100% circular PET trays will be developed. The project includes the creation of tested and validated circular PET trays that can be used as packaging for perishable food. This also includes films, lids, and labels that are easy to be removed or washed off the packaging. By focusing on mono-PET and limiting the presence of other compounds, the redesigned PET trays should be easier to separate and recycle. All of this should happen at a competitive price and quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "How this will affect food packaging\n",
    "Achieving a successful redesign of PET trays will contribute to maintaining valuable carbon in the plastic value chain. This results in a decrease of crude oil demand and less CO2 emissions from end of life incineration. The environmental benefit could be substantial, as tray-to-tray recycling is accompanied by the reduction of a waste stream that now amounts to approximately 900 kilotons per year, which is roughly equal to 3.5 million tons of CO2 emissions in Europe.\n",

    "Lower costs for wireless measuring systems\n",
    "In an industry 4.0 inline sensors will be implemented more and more. Wiring and creating connection to the process control is very expensive. Costs of wireless measuring systems are much lower and can offer more flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with wireless technology new interdependencies and risks are being introduced. As a result of risk analyses recommendations are made for a good mitigation of risks in order to manage the risks there are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Smart strategy to develop a learning community\n",
    "One of the results of the GRIP on drying project is that there is a need for smart strategies to develop Learning Communities. Learning Communities are an important link to building and spreading knowledge through education, life long learning and other channels. Learning Communities are stronger when they are supported by an online community.\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of a Learning Community depends on the objectives of the organisation and participants. Reflection on motivation, objectives and involvement of the participants is recommended. Also to set an objective during a certain period for drawing up of a white paper, a presentation, or a training (Marcelis, 2002).\n",

    "For the GRIP project 2 workshops were organised for the Learning Community of Drying experts. A workshop regarding energy savings during thin film drying and a workshop regarding drying technology and heat pumps in drying processes. During this latter workshop the results of our project VERA were investigated regarding the opportunities for heat pumps in the Dutch industry.\n",

    "\n",
    "The challenge of this BRECSIT project is to develop the processes and conditions by which the GX-resin applications can be realized. With these new technologies in hand, high-end, high-volume products can be manufactured using Plantics GX-resin in the Netherlands and Europe. This will yield high quality jobs, major CO2 reductions, increased product safety and reduce the amount of plastics that end up in the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected results\n",
    "The targeted results include the properties and physical characteristics of the products and the know-how to produce on a larger scale. Furthermore, targeted results include knowledge about the critical parameters and process conditions that determine the applicability, reproducibility and material characteristics (including re-use/ recycling and biodegradability) with different fibers, fiber mats and fillers. Finally, the generic knowledge will be widely spread which will encourage the implementations of these technologies and the use of recyclable bio-resin composites.'''"
