    "CodeCP-50-11StatusOngoingStart dateMarch 1, 2023\n",
    "Packaging is crucial to preserve and protect food that we are using daily. To ensure these qualities, PET trays are often used. However, they have been difficult to recycle. CIRCPET aims to make full recycling, transparent and economically competitive trays possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tested and validated fully circular PET tray for (food) packaging\n",
    "New design with improved recyclability, including developing sealing layers\n",
    "Optimal cost-effectiveness in converting post-use trays into homogenous high quality rPET\n",
    "Destined to grow, difficult to recycle\n",
    "The market for PET trays is vast and rapidly growing, making them an essential part of the food supply chain. However, PET trays are currently difficult to recycle due to mixed materials and contamination. As the demand for recycled PET (rPET) in bottles increases, the availability of rPET for trays decreases. This creates an urgent need for the development of a closed-loop system specifically for PET trays.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to address this challenge by creating a fully circular PET tray solution that meets market demands while minimizing environmental impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Achieving circular PET trays\n",
    "The project brings together multiple parties from the PET tray supply chain together with knowledge institutions. Together 100% circular PET trays will be developed. The project includes the creation of tested and validated circular PET trays that can be used as packaging for perishable food. This also includes films, lids, and labels that are easy to be removed or washed off the packaging. By focusing on mono-PET and limiting the presence of other compounds, the redesigned PET trays should be easier to separate and recycle. All of this should happen at a competitive price and quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "How this will affect food packaging\n",
    "Achieving a successful redesign of PET trays will contribute to maintaining valuable carbon in the plastic value chain. This results in a decrease of crude oil demand and less CO2 emissions from end of life incineration. The environmental benefit could be substantial, as tray-to-tray recycling is accompanied by the reduction of a waste stream that now amounts to approximately 900 kilotons per year, which is roughly equal to 3.5 million tons of CO2 emissions in Europe.\n",

    "This project investigates how inline sensors can help improving product quality and efficiency in 5 industrial cases, using a large consortium of end users, technology suppliers. Together with suppliers of inline moisture sensors and experts the possibilities were investigated to get a GRIP on each drying process. Objective is the application of innovative (sensor) technology that meets the specific innovation needs of the company for drying technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short:\n",
    "\n",
    "GRIP aims to learn how inline sensors can improve product quality\n",
    "But with wireless technology new risks are being introduced\n",
    "So incorporating the human factor is essential when it comes to open innovation\n",
    "Lower costs for wireless measuring systems\n",
    "In an industry 4.0 inline sensors will be implemented more and more. Wiring and creating connection to the process control is very expensive. Costs of wireless measuring systems are much lower and can offer more flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with wireless technology new interdependencies and risks are being introduced. As a result of risk analyses recommendations are made for a good mitigation of risks in order to manage the risks there are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Smart strategy to develop a learning community\n",
    "One of the results of the GRIP on drying project is that there is a need for smart strategies to develop Learning Communities. Learning Communities are an important link to building and spreading knowledge through education, life long learning and other channels. Learning Communities are stronger when they are supported by an online community.\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of a Learning Community depends on the objectives of the organisation and participants. Reflection on motivation, objectives and involvement of the participants is recommended. Also to set an objective during a certain period for drawing up of a white paper, a presentation, or a training (Marcelis, 2002).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also intersting to read\n",
    "The Topsectors introduced Life Long Learning & Development as a result of the Human Capital road map. It it a great instrument for The Netherlands to stay front runner in the field of knowledge and innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find more information in our article Experts choose interaction as preferred way of learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grip Op Drogen - Graphic Life long learning\n",
    "Incorporating the human factor is essential when it comes to open innovation. As a result ISPT introduced Learning Communities as an instrument to stimulate and facilitate knowledge exchange between practitioners, increase interaction among stakeholders, and strengthen collaborations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the GRIP project 2 workshops were organised for the Learning Community of Drying experts. A workshop regarding energy savings during thin film drying and a workshop regarding drying technology and heat pumps in drying processes. During this latter workshop the results of our project VERA were investigated regarding the opportunities for heat pumps in the Dutch industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cyber Security\n",
    "The digitization introduces a new vulnerability, for this reason the program televulnerability of Agentschap Telecom joined the consortium. Their booklet ‘Vijfstappenplan’ (Five step strategy) that was developed within the GRIP on drying project, is creating awareness, and how to assess dependencies and execute risk management.'''\n",

    "CodeCS-20-08StatusCompletedStart dateJune 1, 2019\n",
    "The Bio-based Resin Composite Technologies (BRECSIT) project develops production technologies for high volume production of bio-based and recyclable Plantics-GX composites, thereby replacing conventional, fossil-based plastic composites.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short:\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently there are no 100% bio-based thermosets available on the market\n",
    "Plantics-GX is a competitive alternative to plastics\n",
    "BRECSIT develops the processes and conditions by which the GX-resin applications can be realized\n",
    "Plantics-GX resins: an alternative to conventional plastics\n",
    "Currently there are no 100% bio-based thermosets available on the market. This makes Plantics-GX resins unique, as it presents a cost and functionality competitive alternative to plastics, along with a fully circular product bio-life cycle. Sustainable composites can be formed by combining the GX-resins with bio-based fillers such as hemp fibers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge of this BRECSIT project is to develop the processes and conditions by which the GX-resin applications can be realized. With these new technologies in hand, high-end, high-volume products can be manufactured using Plantics GX-resin in the Netherlands and Europe. This will yield high quality jobs, major CO2 reductions, increased product safety and reduce the amount of plastics that end up in the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected results\n",
    "The targeted results include the properties and physical characteristics of the products and the know-how to produce on a larger scale. Furthermore, targeted results include knowledge about the critical parameters and process conditions that determine the applicability, reproducibility and material characteristics (including re-use/ recycling and biodegradability) with different fibers, fiber mats and fillers. Finally, the generic knowledge will be widely spread which will encourage the implementations of these technologies and the use of recyclable bio-resin composites.'''"
