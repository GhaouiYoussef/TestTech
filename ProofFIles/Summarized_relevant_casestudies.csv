The COMTA pump is based on the thermoacoustic effect, which involves the conversion of heat energy into sound energy and vice versa. The pump consists of a compressor, a regenerator, and a heat exchanger, with a closed loop of gas flowing through the system. The compressor compresses the gas, which generates sound waves that travel through the regenerator and heat exchanger. The sound waves transfer heat energy from the hot source to the cold sink, resulting in the generation of heat at the desired temperature.

The project aims to improve the way to store and reuse thermal energy by using a technology called Phase Changing Materials (PCM). The project is focused on the efficiency of the process and the replacement of fossil resources with renewable ones. The biggest challenge in the energy transition is the varying availability of renewable resources, especially for heat pumps, which can be addressed by using thermal energy storages. The storage of energy is one of the biggest challenges in the transition to a sustainable system, as the cost of electrical storage is expensive. Thermal storage, on the other hand, can be achieved relatively cheaply using PCMs. The composition of PCMs often includes salt and organic materials that change from solid to liquid in the process of storing latent heat, which allows for the storage of a lot of heat in a small volume.

Carlos Infante Ferreira TU Delft Vilborg Gudjonsdottir TU Delft LESSON: Oil free compressor ammonia based high temperature heat pump (in Dutch) Author: Carlos A. Infante Ferreira, Vilborg Gudjonsdottir","The project aims to improve the performance of a high-temperature heat pump by modifying the prototype to vary the internal pressure and cavity volume. The data collected will be used to validate a global performance modeling tool that can be used for different source losses and to identify the source of losses in the compression process of the heat pump, which is critical for high-performance applications. The project will also design a next-generation commercial compressor that can adapt to different source of loss and integrate with a complete compression and resorption model to predict heat pumps' performance in high- temperature applications, as well as design a heat pump with a capacity similar to the present compressor and operate with an ammonia concentration of 35% ammonia-water solution. The experimental data shows that a larger amount of liquid suction in the port guarantees sealing leakage and allows higher pressure ratio. The temperature rise of the working fluid passing through the compressor is also affected by the vapour inlet condition. The discharge temperature of 115 ° C can be delivered to an application of 95 °. The lessons learned from the oil- free wet compressors project identified the source loss of the oil free compressor prototype. The prototype was built in a previous project and the data collected was used to identify and validate the source losses in order to develop a more efficient and reliable high-pressure heat pump for high temperature application."

PINcHED – Process Integrated Heat Pump Drying Author: Anne van der Zwaan","The PINcCHED project is a research project that aims to accelerate the implementation of high-temperatures heat pumps in the industry. The project focuses on drying processes, which account for approximately 7% of the energy used in the Dutch industry.

The project is divided into several steps, with the first step being to establish a fully heat-pump integrated drying system, including the selection of main components and process flow diagrams. The second step is to establish the control philosophy and draft lay-out drawings.

In the third step, the drying process is accounted for 10% of industrial energy, and processes such as paper production use 75% of energy for drying. Therefore, improving energy efficiency in drying processes can contribute significantly to the energy-saving target and reduction of CO2 emission.

Bulk drying processes are either convective or contact drying, and contact drying is suitable for heat pump applications. However, the installed process is equipment in a brown field, and the existing installation is not designed for heat pumps.

To address this issue, the project aims to design a heat pump-driven drying system that is optimized for technical and economic factors. The system will be modeled and calculated to find the optimal balance between standardization and customization.

Overall, the PINcISHED project aims at designing a heat-integrated drying system and establishing a fully integrated heat pump system. The final conclusion of the project will be to establish an economic feasibility of the system and compare different designs to find an optimal balance."
